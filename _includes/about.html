                    <p>My interests are in earth systems and environmental studies with GIS, remote sensing, geospatial, and data analysis tools and techniques. I am involved in Environmental research and project implementation at Integrated Ecodev Systems Konsult (IESK) as a GIS/ Geospatial Data Analyst.  Previously, I worked as an Environmental Planner at Hydro One (Ontario Hydro). My background began in Geography at the University of Ibadan, Nigeria, which I later completed in Environmental Studies with a focus area in Environmental Assessment at the University of Manitoba, Canada. I am currently undertaking a Masters Degree in Geographic Information Systems and Remote Sensing at Charles Sturt University in Australia.</p>
