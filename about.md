I am currently a GIS/ Geospatial Data Analyst at Integrated Ecodev Systems Konsult (IESK). My interests are in earth systems and environmental studies with GIS, remote sensing, geospatial, and data analysis tools and techniques. Previously, I worked as an Environmental Planner at Hydro One (Ontario Hydro).

At IESK, I worked on modeling emissions & emission reduction from circular economy (CE) analysis in the waste management sector. This study was commissioned to analyze the impact of CE in the waste management sector of Nigeria so that its outcome can be incorporated into the NDC revision 2021-2025.

My background began in Geography at the **University of Ibadan**, Nigeria, which I later completed in Environmental Studies with a focus area in Environmental Assessment at the **University of Manitoba**, Canada. I am currently undertaking a Masters Degree in Geographic Information Systems and Remote Sensing at Charles Sturt University in Australia. I reside in Winnipeg, Manitoba, with my beautiful wife, Beulah.
